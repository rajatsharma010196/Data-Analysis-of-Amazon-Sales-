**Problem Statement**:

Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved distribution methods to reduce costs and increase profits. Sales management is now the most critical function in commercial and business enterprises. The task is to perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on an Amazon dataset and analyze the sales trends on a monthly, yearly, and yearly-monthly basis. Discover key metrics and factors, and establish meaningful relationships between attributes. Conduct your own research and present your findings.
